# :email: HTML Email Newsletter

This project demonstrates my skills at creating an HTML email newsletter.

## Content

Rebuild of an email newsletter sent out by Tim Ferriss.

This email uses a hybrid approach to reconfigure the layout for different screen sizes for email clients regardless of media query support. At its core, it uses max-width and min-width to impose rigid
baselines (allowing some movement) and imposes a fixed, wide width for Outlook who is shackled to the desktop anyway. Once a mobile-friendly baseline is set, media queries progressively enhance the
email further in clients that support it.
